We get to help people save money by using less energy: a unique design challenge, but an edifying one.</h3>
<p>When we set out to design a site for the team, we wanted it to accomplish three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become a resource for information and inspiration for other design teams</li>
<li>Showcase some of the thinking and process that goes into our product design</li>
<li>Pique the interests of anyone wanting to collaborate with us</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JimJones">Jim Jones</a> was the genius behind the sharp visuals; my contributions were project management, illustration, and code. We wanted the site to tell a linear story, so we went with a single-page format that ends with a call-to-action to get in contact with the team.</p>

<p>I had a little fun with the illustrations. Rosie (the team dog) had trouble sitting still to pose for her headshot.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>I got to experiment with some new tech on this project! My dev environment included everything that I usually roll with: <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> for package management, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> for task management, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/sass/libsass">Libsass</a>) for style, <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> for great Sass shortcuts, and various other timesavers. The new tech I incorporated was <a href="http://assemble.io/">Assemble</a>, which is a really great static site generator that runs on Node.js. Assemble allowed us to use <a href="">Handlebars</a> and Markdown format to build the project, but assembles everything into static files with a simple Grunt task. Assemble lays the path for lovely separation of concerns: I keep content in YAML content files, structure in Handlebars files, and reusable components in partials.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m also happy to report that the javascript is of the pure vanilla kind: no frameworks or plugins found here, other than d3 and <a href="https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify">Trianglify</a> for the beautiful background geometry.</p>
